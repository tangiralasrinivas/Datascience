## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r library}
library(psych)
library(ggplot2, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

```{r attitude}
summary(attitude)
```

```{r cor-attitude}
cor(attitude)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r multihist}
multi.hist(attitude, freq = TRUE, breaks = 10)
```

```{r multiscatterplot}
pairs(attitude, panel=points, gap=0, main="Simple Scatterplot Matrix For Attitude dataset")

```


```{r multiboxplot}
boxplot(attitude)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
